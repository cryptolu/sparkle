# Sparkle, Schwaemm and Esch

The reposiory contains the implementation of the SPARKLE family of primitives. 

The Sparkle-suite is a collection of lightweight symmetric cryptographic algorithms currently in the final round of the **NIST** standardisation effort. It contains both **Authenticated Ciphers with Associated Data (AEAD)** and **hash functions**. Their implementation on microcontrollers is both very small (low ROM/RAM footprint) and very fast (low cycle count per processed byte). 

The Sparkle [paper](https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/8627/8193) appeared in the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology (ToSC) Special Issue on Designs for the NIST Lightweight Standardisation Process.
